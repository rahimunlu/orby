# Orby - Festival Wallet

Orby is a mobile-first digital wallet application for festival attendees. It enables users to:

- Join festivals and receive a wallet address
- Top up their wallet by converting USDT to festival-specific tokens
- View balances (USDT and festival tokens)
- Cash out remaining tokens back to USDT
- Scan/display QR codes for payments

The platform also includes an admin interface for festival organizers to deploy custom ERC-20 festival tokens on-chain.

## Target Users

- Festival attendees (mobile wallet users)
- Festival organizers (admin dashboard for token deployment)

## Current State

The application is in development with mock blockchain interactions. The in-memory store simulates balances while the smart contract integration is being built out.
